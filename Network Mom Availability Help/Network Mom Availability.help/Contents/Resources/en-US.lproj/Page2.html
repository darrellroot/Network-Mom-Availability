            <span class="Normal">The standard Apple "Licensed Application End User License Agreement" already expresses the "AS IS" nature of the application in paragraph e, making the above terms redundant. But we emphasize that Network Mom Availability is just one imperfect tool to help detect outages. Not an omniscient infallible tool. If you demand a perfect tool, don't use Network Mom Availability and please delete any binaries you already downloaded.&nbsp;</span>

        <p class="Left Normal">
            <span class="Normal">Network Mom LLC encourages customers to operate two Network Mom Availability instances to monitor each other (in addition to monitoring the network) from two different locations. Purchasing Network Mom Availability allows multiple Network Mom Availability instances to be operated by one organization under one Apple ID with only one purchase. Even with this mitigation, certain types of outages may not be detected or may prevent Network Mom Availability from successfully alerting support personnel.</span>
