            <span class="Normal">Network Mom Availability sends email using SMTP encrypted with TLS on TCP port 587.  Email providers require an authenticated username and password to send email.  Many email providers require 2-factor authentication for the first use of email which Network Mom Availability does not support.</span>

        <p class="Left Normal">
            <span class="Normal">This may require you to request an “application specific password” (iCloud) or “allow less secure applications” (Google) for you to send email successfully with your provider.</span>

            <span class="Normal">Network Mom Availability saves the email password in process memory and (encrypted) in the Apple keychain on the monitoring host.  Whether you enable iCloud keychain syncing is up to you.  Network Mom Availability does not save the email password in any other location.  Anyone with the user account password of the monitoring Macintosh can run Utilities -&gt; Keychain Access to view the email password.</span>

        <p class="Left Normal">
            <span class="Normal">We recommend using a dedicated non-personal email account with a unique password for originating alerts and reports.  You need to monitor this email address from your email client to receive “email permission code” replies and bounce messages.</span>

Choosing a “fast and reliable” email provider may be helpful.  Network outages can also prevent email delivery, which would prevent outage alert delivery.</span>
