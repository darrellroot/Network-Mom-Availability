IT engineers need an easy way to know what devices are up and what devices are down.  The best way to improve availability is to measure availability.  WAN engineers need to monitor network latency.  Outage alerts and availability reports should be easy to setup.
<p>
Network Mom Availability attempts to meet these requirements so engineers can keep an eye on their network.
