<h1>Network Mom Credits</h1>
<h2>Swift</h2>
Network Mom is written in Swift: the new programming language developed by Apple.  Chris Lattner led the original development.  I first learned to program in Basic on the TRS-80, Apple II, and Atari 800 around 1980.  Swift is the best programming language I ever used.  The strict types and optionals, in particular, prevent many programming errors.  Thanks to Swift its fun to program again!
<p>
More generally, I thank Apple for the entire development and user environment.  I love having an easy-to-use computer with Unix under the hood.  Xcode.  The frameworks.  MacOS App Store.  All required for me to be successful with Network Mom.
<h2>Charts</h2>
Network Mom uses the Charts framework available at https://cocoapods.org/pods/Charts by Daniel Cohen Gindi and Philipp Jahoda.  Charts is made available under the Apache-2.0 license.
<h2>Swift-SMTP, LoggerAPI, BlueCryptor, BlueSocket, BlueSSLService</h2>
These libraries, made available on GitHub under https://github.com/IBM-Swift by IBM, are covered by the Apache-2.0 license.  Thank you IBM!
<h2>SwiftyPing</h2>
SwiftyPing is available on Github at https://github.com/imas145/SwiftyPing by user imas145 under the MIT license.  While I don't use the source code directly, figuring out how to send ICMP packets with Swift and the CFNetwork (Objective-C-based) framework was difficult.  imas145's SwiftyPing example was essential.
<h2>MRTG/RRDtool</h2>
Tobi Oetiker's MRTG and RRDtool at https://www.oetiker.ch/en/oss/projects/ have been the gold standard for network bandwidth monitoring for decades.  While I don't use any of their source code (wrong language!), my availability and latency data structures are designed similarly to Tobi's "round robin database".  Their charts, in particular, are beautiful.
<h2>raywenderlich.com</h2>
The books and tutorials available at raywenderlich.com are beyond compare.  The iOS apprentice book, in particular, helped me get back into serious software development after decades as an IT network engineer.
