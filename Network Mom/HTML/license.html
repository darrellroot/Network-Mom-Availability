<h1>Network Mom License Agreement</h1>
        Network Mom users are subject to the standard Apple "Licensed Application End User License Agreement" available at https://www.apple.com/legal/macapps/stdeula/ with the following additional terms:
        <p>
        Network Mom, like any software, can fail.  It can crash, fail to detect an outage, or fail to alert on an outage.  Alerts can fail to be delivered to support teams for many reasons (including the outage itself preventing delivery).  Network Mom can also lose configuration, monitoring or latency data.  Darrell Root LLC is not responsible and not liable for any damages, direct, or indirect, due to a failure of Network Mom to detect or alert on an outage.  Darrell Root LLC is not responsible and not liable for any damages due to a loss of Network Mom configuration or historic monitoring data.  It is also possible for Network Mom to generate an abnormal amount of network traffic or email (although, as of December 2018, the development version of Network Mom has never done this).  It is possible that Network Mom may generate improperly formatted monitoring traffic.  It is possible that devices on your network may react badly to Network Mom generated traffic (whether such traffic is formatted correctly or incorrectly).  Darrell Root LLC is not responsible for damages caused by network traffic caused by Network Mom.
       <p>
	      The standard Apple "Licensed Application End User License Agreement" already expresses the "AS IS" nature of the application in paragraph e, making the above terms redundant.  But we emphasize that Network Mom is just one imperfect tool to help detect outages.  Not an omniscient infallible tool.  If you demand a perfect tool, don't purchase Network Mom and please delete any binaries you have already downloaded.  Allowing you to determine if Network Mom meets your needs is the primary reason we offer a 30-day free trial.
	      <p>
        Darrell Root LLC encourages customers to operate two Network Mom instances to monitor each other (in addition to monitoring the network) from two different locations.  The default in-app license purchase allows multiple Network Mom instances to be operated by one organization under one Apple ID with only one purchase.  Even with this mitigation, certain types of outages may not be detected or may prevent Network Mom from successfully alerting support personnel.
