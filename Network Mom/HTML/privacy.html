<h1>Network Mom Privacy Policy</h1>
Darrell Root LLC does not want your private information and does not collect your information via Network Mom.
<ol>
	<li>Network Mom needs permission for inbound and outbound network connections to monitor the network, send alerts, and send reports.  Network Mom does not use this to send any information back to Darrell Root LLC or any other party.  Network Mom also does not send any emails to Darrell Root LLC unless you configure us (presumably erroneously) as an alert or report destination.
	<li>To enable email alerts, Network Mom needs email account credentials for the "from" email address.  This information is only used to send emails and is only stored on your local Network Mom host.  The password, in particular, is only saved in the Network Mom in-process memory and in the Keychain.
	<li>To use email alerts and reports, you need to configure Network Mom with destination email addresses.  Network Mom saves that configuration on your Network Mom host.  Network Mom uses that information to send email alerts and reports as you configure.  But those email addresses are not harvested by Network Mom.
	<li>Darrell Root LLC also considers the list of devices you monitor as private information.  Network Mom does not harvest this information.  Network Mom does include the list of monitored devices in reports emailed to your report recipients.  This allows your report recipients to know what devices are monitored.  This also constitutes an "emergency backup" allowing easier reconstruction of your Network Mom configuration should a loss of configuration occur.
	<li>Network Mom uses in-app purchases for monetization.  Those in-app purchases involve sending some data to Apple.  Darrell Root LLC receives some aggregated information from Apple regarding in-app purchases (including, but not limited to, number of sales, types of sales, geographic region of sales).  Any data you enter to execute in-app purchases is not sent directly to Darrell Root LLC or any other third party.
	<li>If you choose to send an email to Darrell Root LLC (outside of Network Mom, or if you erroneously make us an alert or report recipient), Darrell Root LLC may save and respond to your email address.  We may also infrequently send you product information and inquiries.
</ol>
