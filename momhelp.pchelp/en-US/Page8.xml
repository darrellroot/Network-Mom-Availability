            <content style="Normal0">Network Mom Availability is written in Swift: the new programming language developed by Apple.  Chris Lattner led the original development.  Swift is an excellent programming language.  The strict types and optionals, in particular, prevent many programming errors.  We also thank Apple for the entire Macintosh development environment.</content>

While we do not use the source code directly, figuring out how to send ICMP packets with Swift and the CFNetwork (Objective-C-based) framework was difficult.  imas145's SwiftyPing example was essential.</content>

            <content style="Normal0">Tobi Oetiker's MRTG and RRDtool at https://www.oetiker.ch/en/oss/projects/ have been the gold standard for network bandwidth monitoring for decades.  While we don't use any of their source code (wrong language!), our availability and latency data structures are designed similarly to Tobi's "round robin database".  MRTGâ€™s charts, in particular, are beautiful.  Thank you Tobi!</content>
